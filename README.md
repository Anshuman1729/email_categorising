# Email Classifier

The Email Classifier is a machine learning solution that categorizes emails based on content. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, the system analyzes the content of emails and classifies them into relevant categories such as action items, escalations, support requirements, urgency, and product or service-related queries. 

This solution improves the efficiency and productivity of email management by reducing the time and effort spent on sorting through emails and prioritizing important ones. The system is also capable of learning from user feedback and adapting to changes in email patterns over time.

## Technologies Used
* Java
* Apache OpenNLP
* Maven
* Machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, LDA)
* Natural Language Processing techniques
<!-- * Sentiment Analysis and Intent Recognition -->

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Email-Classifier.git
```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE
3. Add the necessary dependencies (Apache OpenNLP, etc.) to the project
4. Run the project

## Usage
The Email Classifier can be integrated into existing email systems for scalability and adaptability. It categorizes emails automatically, improving efficiency and productivity by reducing email management time and prioritizing important emails. 

## Further Development
The Email Classifier project can be extended to incorporate more advanced features such as sentiment analysis and intent recognition for more accurate email classification. It can also be scaled to handle large datasets and integrated into email management systems for commercial use.
